css ground rules

- use variables for all colours: mydark, mylight, myblack, mywhite
    - myblack with mywhite, mydark with mylight
- use variables for fonts, one font across whole site (with bolding optionally)
- consistent background colour across whole site

- margins should be consistent
- rounded corners
- cute, whimsical illustrations - keep professional

- focus on usability + content, then everything else
