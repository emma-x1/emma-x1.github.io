<p>There's a lot to love outside of tech.</p>
<li>My favourite way to destress is to run. I ran the Toronto Half Marathon this year, and my current Strava streak is about 35 weeks long.</li>
<li>If I could, I'd read all the time. I consume writing voraciously - whether that's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185891057-emma">novels</a>, blog posts, or Substack articles.</li>
<li>I dabble in baking - I've made cookies, puff pastry, and churros.</li>
<li>Cultivating a vibrant builder ecosystem is important to me. That's why I worked on logistics for Hack The North 2025, where I organized mentorship and activities, and helped build our CTF challenge.</li>
<li>Empowering beginners in tech allows us to inspire more talented engineers, and I've worked in support of this mission by leading Hack404, Celestial, and Solstice - three beginner-friendly hackathons.</li>
