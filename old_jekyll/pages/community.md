I love connecting with other people, and connecting other people to each other. Here's what I've worked on.

- Hack the North
    - _Logistics Organizer, Mar 2025 - Present_
    - _Workshop Lead, Sept 2024_
    - [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com) is the largest hackathon in Canada, attracting 1000+ students from around the world to dream big and build bigger.
    - For HTN 2025, I coordinated the logistics of Hack the North, specifically working on activities and mentorship. I crafted activities that would give our hackers the chance to experience things they wouldn't normally get to do, like rock climbing and puppy yoga. I also organized mentorship, selecting 100+ mentors to provide the technical and project-oriented support to our hackers to allow them to make the best possible project.
    - For HTN 2024, I led a workshop on printed circuit boards to 50+ hackers! I taught the basics of PCBs and walked hackers through designing and manufacturing their own from start to finish.
- Hack404
    - _Director, Mar 2025 - Present_
    - [Hack404](https://hack404.dev) is a two-day GTA-based hackathon for 200+ secondary and post-secondary students which aims to equip students with the skills necessary for today's tech landscape, both by introducing beginners to tech and by encouraging experienced hackers to develop alongside cutting edge tech (AI/ML, web3, cybersecurity).
    - I led a team of 25+ to coordinate logistics, finances/sponsorship, design, web, and marketing of our hackathon, coordinating dependencies between teams and externally, and managing the project.
    - My goal was to ensure that our organizing team was able to learn and have fun while creating an event that was purposeful and positive to our community.
- Bracketbot Hackathon
- Hack Club & Days of Service
    - _Lead Organizer, Jul 2025 - Sept 2025_
    - _Dinner Lead, Sept 2024 - Jun 2025_
    - I led a Toronto-based hackathon - Celestial - that reached 80+ girls in the GTA, which focused on introducing girls and gender minorities to tech. I coordinated a team of 10+ to orchestrate the logistics, technical workshops, and marketing to make the event happen.
    - I was the dinner lead for the Chicago chapter, Solstice, where I led a dinner for our organizers to connect with 10+ inspiring women in the field of tech, performing outreach and coordinating the flow of the dinner to introduce meaningful conversation and connection.
- Night It Up!
    - _Sales Associate, Mar 2023 - Aug 2023_
    - [Night It Up!](https://nightitup.com) is a weekend-long night market in Markham, ON that drew over 130,000 attendees and raised $10,000 for our beneficiary, ALS DoublePlay. 
    - As the sales associate, I worked closely with the director of sales to manage relationships with 100+ food and merchandise vendors, maintaining constant communication with vendors and other teams and ensuring we followed appropriate safety protocols while orchestrating logistics of a large-scale community event.
- Misc.
    - Volunteered at Southlake Regional Health Center as an ICU liason and at Richmond Hill camps as an inclusion support coordinator with children with special needs.
